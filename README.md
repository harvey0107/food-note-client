This is the client-side of the web application "Foodie Note", a site for users to create and update their own restaurant infomation. Users can create, update see workout records and destory.

The client was built with JavaScript, CSS/SASS, HTML5, and Bootstrap. It interacts with a backend I built with JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose-- the GitHub repo and deployed heroku site can be found here: https://github.com/harvey0107/food-note-api, https://young-ravine-24005.herokuapp.com/

In building this project, I planned to finish the CRUD functionality with collections before I started working on the frontend. so i finished backend in first two day and start my authorization functions to make sure every users able to signUp, signIn ,signOut, and changePassword. I started my the functions of my app after authorization. users able to create their restaurant infomation then see and updatethe records and finally delete thire records. last but not least I used CSS and Bootstrap to design the layout and color of my app.
